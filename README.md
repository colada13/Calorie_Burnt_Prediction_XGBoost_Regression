# Calorie Burnt Prediction using XGBoost Regression

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the number of calories burnt during physical activities using the **XGBoost Regression** algorithm. By analyzing features such as age, gender, height, weight, and activity duration, the model provides accurate predictions for calorie expenditure.

## Objectives
- Explore and preprocess the dataset for effective feature engineering.
- Train and evaluate the XGBoost Regression model for calorie prediction.
- Compare the performance of XGBoost Regression with other regression algorithms.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:
- **Age**: Age of the individual.
- **Gender**: Male/Female classification.
- **Height**: Height in centimeters.
- **Weight**: Weight in kilograms.
- **Duration**: Duration of physical activity in minutes.
- **Heart Rate**: Average heart rate during the activity.
- **Calories Burnt**: The target variable representing calories burnt during the activity.

*Note*: Ensure proper handling of confidential data and cite the source of the dataset if publicly available.

## Features
The project includes:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numeric features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing relationships between features and calorie expenditure.
- **Model Training**: Implementing and optimizing the XGBoost Regression algorithm.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
